## Principle 2: Give honest and sincere appreciation.
1. The only one way to get anybody to do anything is by making the other person want to do it.
2. What do you want? ** the desire to be important**
> Let's cease thinking of our accomplishments, our wants. Let's try to figure out the other person's good points.


## Principle 3: 

>First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way."
