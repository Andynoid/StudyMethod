## Principle 1: Don't criticise, condemn or complain.

## Principle 2: Give honest and sincere appreciation.
1. The only one way to get anybody to do anything is by making the other person want to do it.
2. What do you want? ** the desire to be important**
> Let's cease thinking of our accomplishments, our wants. Let's try to figure out the other person's good points.

## Principle 3: Arouse in the other person an eager want.

>First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way."


> If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from that person's angle as well as from your own.



# Part 2 - Ways to make people like you.

## Principle 1: Become genuinely interested in other people.
>It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difjculties in life and provides the greutest injury to others. It is from umong such individuals that all humun failures spring.

>You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.

> Remember other people's birthday.

## Principle 2: A simple way to make a good first impression. ---- Smile.

>You don't feel like smiling? Then what? Two things. First, force yourself to smile. If you are alone, force yourself to whistle or hum a tune or sing. Act as if you were already happy, and that will tend to make you happy. Here is the way the psychologist and philosopher William James put it:

>Every body in the world is seeking happiness - and there is one sure way to find it. That is by controlling your thoughts. Happiness doesn't depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner conditions.

> Picture in your mind the able, earnest, useful person you desire to be, and the thought you hold is hourly transforming you into that particular individual.. . .

### (If you don't do this, you are headed for trouble)
## Principle 3:  Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.

>Franklin D. Roosevelt knew that one of the simplest, most obvious and most important ways of gaining good will was by remembering names and making people feel important - yet how many of us do it?

>Half the time we are introduced to a stranger, we chat a few minutes and can't even remember his or her name by the time we say goodbye.

>His technique? Simple. If he didn't hear the name distinctly, he said, "So sorry. I didn't get the name clearly." Then, if it was an unusual name, he would say, "How is it spelled?"

### An easy way to become a good conversationalist.
## Principle 4 - Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.

Remember that the people you are talking to are a hundred times more interested in themselves and their wants and problems than they are in you and your problems.


### How to interest people.
## Principle 5 - Talk in terms of the other person's interests.

### How to make people like you instantly.
## Principle 6 - Make the other person feel important-and do it sincerely.

> In fact, that law, if obeyed, will bring us countless friends and constant happiness. But the very instant we break the law, we shall get into endless trouble. The law is this: Always make the other person feel important

>Confucius preached it in China twenty-four centuries ago. Lao-tse, the founder of Taoism, taught it to his disciples in the Valley of the Han. Buddha preached it on the bank of the Holy Ganges five hundred years before Christ. The sacred books of Hinduism taught it a thousand years before that. Jesus taught it among the stony hills of Judea nineteen centuries ago. Jesus summed it up in one thought -probably the most important rule in the world: "Do unto others as you would have others do unto you."

# Part Three - How to win people to your way of thinking.

### You can't win an argument.
## Principle 1 The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.

>  Bits and Pieces, published by The Economics Press, Fairfield, N.J.
Opera tenor Jan Peerce, after he was married nearly fifty years, once said: "My wife and I made a pact a long time ago, and we've kept it no matter how angry we've grown with each other. When one yells, the other should listen-because when two people yell, there is no communication, just noise and bad vibrations."


### A sure way of making enemies and how to avoid it.
## Principle 2: Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say, " you are wrong."
> Over three hundred years ago Galileo said:
You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it within himself.

> "I may be wrong. I frequently am. Let's examine the facts."
Nobody in the heavens above or on earth beneath or in the waters under the earth will ever object to your saying: "I may be wrong. Let's examine the facts."

>Few people are logical. Most of us are prejudiced and biased. Most of us are blighted with preconceived notions, with jealousy, suspicion, fear, envy and pride. And most citizens don't want to change their minds about their religion or their haircut or communism or their favorite movie star. So, if you are inclined to tell people they are wrong, please read the following paragraph every morning before breakfast.

### If you are wrong, Admit it.
## Principle 3 - If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.

> Come to think it over, I don't entirely agree with it myself. Not everything I wrote yesterday appeals to me today. I am glad to learn what you think on the subject. The next time you are in the neighborhood you must visit us and we'll get this subject threshed out for all time. So here is a handclasp over the miles, and I am,
