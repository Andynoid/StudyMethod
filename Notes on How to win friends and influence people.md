## Principle 1: Don't criticise, condemn or complain.

## Principle 2: Give honest and sincere appreciation.
1. The only one way to get anybody to do anything is by making the other person want to do it.
2. What do you want? ** the desire to be important**
> Let's cease thinking of our accomplishments, our wants. Let's try to figure out the other person's good points.


## Principle 3: Arouse in the other person an eager want.

>First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way."


> If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from that person's angle as well as from your own.



# Part 2 - Ways to make people like you.

## Principle 1: Become genuinely interested in other people.
>It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difjculties in life and provides the greutest injury to others. It is from umong such individuals that all humun failures spring.

>You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.

> Remember other people's birthday.

## Principle 2: A simple way to make a good first impression. ---- Smile.

>You don't feel like smiling? Then what? Two things. First, force yourself to smile. If you are alone, force yourself to whistle or hum a tune or sing. Act as if you were already happy, and that will tend to make you happy. Here is the way the psychologist and philosopher William James put it:

>Every body in the world is seeking happiness - and there is one sure way to find it. That is by controlling your thoughts. Happiness doesn't depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner conditions.
How to Win Friends and Influence People

> Picture in your mind the able, earnest, useful person you desire to be, and the thought you hold is hourly transforming you into that particular individual.. . .

### (If you don't do this, you are headed for trouble)
## Principle 3:  Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.

>Franklin D. Roosevelt knew that one of the simplest, most obvious and most important ways of gaining good will was by remembering names and making people feel important - yet how many of us do it?

>Half the time we are introduced to a stranger, we chat a few minutes and can't even remember his or her name by the time we say goodbye.

>His technique? Simple. If he didn't hear the name distinctly, he said, "So sorry. I didn't get the name clearly." Then, if it was an unusual name, he would say, "How is it spelled?"

### An easy way to become a good conversationalist.
