# Chapter 1 The rise of global middle class and global plutocrats

## Who has gained from globalisation?
- The gains from globalisation is not evenly distributed.
- *elephant curve* of percentile income gain distribution 
1. low income (<30%)
2. Global middle class (40-70%, 1000-2000$/y) **Winner** 
3. Lower middle income in rich country (80 percentile, 5000-10000$/y): **Loser** little- none income gain.
4. High income in rich country (Top 1-5%, >71000$/y )**Winner**

## Development in globalisation.
- Hyper rich people have increase 5 times in number and their wealth increased from 1% global total wealth to 2% from 1987-2013
- Development in high globalisation: 1. Increased amount of hyper-rich people and rise of global middle class.

# Chapter 2 Inequalities within nations.
## Dissatisfaction with the Kuznets Hypothesis.
- Kuznuets hypothesis: the "U" shaped inequality curve against economic development in country.
- Tinbergen: Race between technology and education
- Piketty: Inequality always rise under capitalism.

## Kuznets Waves
- Modern ways of reduce inequalities: War and welfare. (Education?)
- Preindustrial economics: unchanging mean income &uarr; and accidental events: wars, epidemics...
- ** The interplay between economic and political factors drives the cycle.
- TOP: Technology Openness and policy.
-Countries as examples: US and UK, Spain and Italy, Germany and Netherland, Brazil and Chile, Japan.
-Historical data does not support a trade off between growth and inequality.
1. First wave: &uarr; transfer from agriculture to industry. &darr; war and rural area into urban area.
2. Second wave. &uarr; information technology and globalisation.

## The second wave
- Decline in trade union density underpins the process of the weakening of the bargaining position of labor VS capital.,.
