# Chapter 1 The rise of global middle class and global plutocrats

## Who has gained from globalisation?
- The gains from globalisation is not evenly distributed.
- *elephant curve* of percentile income gain distribution 
1. low income (<30%)
2. Global middle class (40-70%, 1000-2000$/y) **Winner** 
3. Lower middle income in rich country (80 percentile, 5000-10000$/y): **Loser** little- none income gain.
4. High income in rich country (Top 1-5%, >71000$/y )**Winner**

## Development in globalisation.
- Hyper rich people have increase 5 times in number and their wealth increased from 1% global total wealth to 2% from 1987-2013
- Development in high globalisation: 1. Increased amount of hyper-rich people and rise of global middle class.

# Chapter 2 Inequalities within nations.
## Dissatisfaction with the Kuznets Hypothesis.
- Kuznuets hypothesis: the "U" shaped inequality curve against economic development in country.
- Tinbergen: Race between technology and education
- Piketty: Inequality always rise under capitalism.

## Kuznets Waves
- Modern ways of reduce inequalities: War and welfare. (Education?)
- Preindustrial economics: unchanging mean income &uarr; and accidental events: wars, epidemics...
- ** The interplay between economic and political factors drives the cycle.
- TOP: Technology Openness and policy.
-Countries as examples: US and UK, Spain and Italy, Germany and Netherland, Brazil and Chile, Japan.
-Historical data does not support a trade off between growth and inequality.
1. First wave: &uarr; transfer from agriculture to industry. &darr; war and rural area into urban area.
2. Second wave. &uarr; information technology and globalisation.

## The second wave
**Uphill of the second wave**
- Decline in trade union density underpins the process of the weakening of the bargaining position of labor VS capital.,.
- Increased labor number: Opening of China and India. Female involvement of working.

**Down hill of the second wave**
- Political changes to higher taxation
- Education and skills
- Reduced rents left from second technology revolutions (<2006)
- Pro low-skilled worker technologies,
- State Health and Education systems.
- Income converge at global level.

# Chapter 3 Inequality among Countries
## Location and Class component
- Balanced by rising of China and India.
- Class was the major component in 1850
- Location is the major component new (80%)

## Citizenship premium
- People born in rich country receive a rent from rich country.
- Class distribution of citizenship premium.
- Citizenship premium and migration policy.

## The Coase theorem and role of law in globalization.
- Privatisation of Communist asset  and the establishment of private asset in Russia and Coase theorem. However, TAR believe leaving the distribution out of economy is wrong. And this theory does not consider globalization.
- Capital outflow of China to other countries.

## Global inequality of opportunity
- There is no equal opportunity globally currently.
- Should we solve this problem? -- Policy philosophers.
- Asset transfer between generations and nations.
- Implicit contract between international citizens
> Rawls and *Theory of justice* and *Law of justice*

## Migration and Walls
** Contradiction at the heart of Globalization: The labor is the production factor that is not seemless moved, but capital is.**
- Migration does not increase from 1980-2000 (1.3%) to 2.2% 2013 
- The conflict between stagnate migration number and the pressure from the needs of migrating to richer country.
- Physical barrier between rich country and poor country.

##  Reconcile Migration with unwillingness to Open boarders
Tensions in migration problem:
1. The right to leave their own country and the lack of right to move to the country they see fit.
2. Two aspect of globalization: one encourages the movement of capital and the other severely limits the right of movement of labor.
3. The economic principle of maximization of income and its application within countries but not globally: Maximization of income in each country does not means maximising global income.
4. The concept of development: development of people within country and the betterness in another country,
- Domain exclusion as well as discrimination existed for balancing migration potential.
- Gray areas in citizenship created by legal residency without vote right.
- Payback from migrants:
