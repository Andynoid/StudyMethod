# Chapter 1 The rise of global middle class and global plutocrats

## Who has gained from globalisation?
- The gains from globalisation is not evenly distributed.
- *elephant curve* of percentile income gain distribution 
1. low income (<30%)
2. Global middle class (40-70%, 1000-2000$/y) **Winner** 
3. Lower middle income in rich country (80 percentile, 5000-10000$/y): **Loser** little- none income gain.
4. High income in rich country (Top 1-5%, >71000$/y )**Winner**

## Development in globalisation.
- Hyper rich people have increase 5 times in number and their wealth increased from 1% global total wealth to 2% from 1987-2013
- Development in high globalisation: 1. Increased amount of hyper-rich people and rise of global middle class.

# Chapter 2 Inequalities within nations.
## Dissatisfaction with the Kuznets Hypothesis.
- Kuznuets hypothesis: the "U" shaped inequality curve against economic development in country.
- Tinbergen: Race between technology and education
- Piketty: Inequality always rise under capitalism.

## Kuznets Waves
- Modern ways of reduce inequalities: War and welfare. (Education?)
- Preindustrial economics: unchanging mean income &uarr; and accidental events: wars, epidemics...
- ** The interplay between economic and political factors drives the cycle.
- TOP: Technology Openness and policy.
-Countries as examples: US and UK, Spain and Italy, Germany and Netherland, Brazil and Chile, Japan.
-Historical data does not support a trade off between growth and inequality.
1. First wave: &uarr; transfer from agriculture to industry. &darr; war and rural area into urban area.
2. Second wave. &uarr; information technology and globalisation.

## The second wave
**Uphill of the second wave**
- Decline in trade union density underpins the process of the weakening of the bargaining position of labor VS capital.,.
- Increased labor number: Opening of China and India. Female involvement of working.

**Down hill of the second wave**
- Political changes to higher taxation
- Education and skills
- Reduced rents left from second technology revolutions (<2006)
- Pro low-skilled worker technologies,
- State Health and Education systems.
- Income converge at global level.

# Chapter 3 Inequality among Countries
## Location and Class component
- Balanced by rising of China and India.
- Class was the major component in 1850
- Location is the major component new (80%)

## Citizenship premium
- People born in rich country receive a rent from rich country.
- Class distribution of citizenship premium.
- Citizenship premium and migration policy.

## The Coase theorem and role of law in globalization.
- Privatisation of Communist asset  and the establishment of private asset in Russia and Coase theorem. However, TAR believe leaving the distribution out of economy is wrong. And this theory does not consider globalization.
- Capital outflow of China to other countries.

## Global inequality of opportunity
- There is no equal opportunity globally currently.
- Should we solve this problem? -- Policy philosophers.
- Asset transfer between generations and nations.
- Implicit contract between international citizens
> Rawls and *Theory of justice* and *Law of justice*

## Migration and Walls
** Contradiction at the heart of Globalization: The labor is the production factor that is not seemless moved, but capital is.**
- Migration does not increase from 1980-2000 (1.3%) to 2.2% 2013 
- The conflict between stagnate migration number and the pressure from the needs of migrating to richer country.
- Physical barrier between rich country and poor country.

##  Reconcile Migration with unwillingness to Open boarders
Tensions in migration problem:
1. The right to leave their own country and the lack of right to move to the country they see fit.
2. Two aspect of globalization: one encourages the movement of capital and the other severely limits the right of movement of labor.
3. The economic principle of maximization of income and its application within countries but not globally: Maximization of income in each country does not means maximising global income.
4. The concept of development: development of people within country and the betterness in another country,
- Domain exclusion as well as discrimination existed for balancing migration potential.
- Gray areas in citizenship created by legal residency without vote right.
- Payback from migrants: higher tax or longer labor time.

# Chapter 4 Global inequality in this century and the Next.
## Intro
- Discussion of economic forecast are strongly limited by popular beliefs at certain ages.
- View of convergence of capitalism and socialism at 60-70s. However, socialism collapse and second technology revolution and the rise of China and India was missing.
- Generally, forecast: the wrong belief that the current trend will continue; the inability to predict single event; over-exaggerate focus o key global players.

## Outline of Main forces: Economic convergence and Kuznets waves.
- With globalisation, there should be income convergence.
- Richest country may either be more rich or began to fall down in the future.
- Wars are linked to economical benefits.
- Breakdown of country or civil wars: Political transition of China, current civil war of Iraq and Syria.

## Income convergence
- Poor countries may grow faster than rich counties?
- Globalization in theory suggest so with easy access to technology and advance policy.
- However, un-population-weighted data suggests a mixed convergence and divergence from 1960-2010 
- Weighted data by population suggests a convergence.
- ** The key force of declined global inequality: higher growth rate in emerging economy from mid-1980s**

## Is convergence an Asian phenomenon?
- Convergence is because the fast growth of populus asian countries.
- Africa and Latin America are left behind.
- Africa have a cyclic economic decline and spurt with very high GDP shortfall: the inability to sustain growth or even level of production.
- A very 'loose' prediction of next 40 years by Hellebrandt and Mauro(2015) in *E4.1*: ~ 6 percent decrease of Gini 

## Inequality in China and US
- **China**: Little household data available. **Kuznets and Lewis** *Turing point at the same time in the future. *
- Top down power structure and decentralised province system.
- Political instability in China.
- ** May be at the peak of the first Kuznets curve**
- US: rising inequality in the foreseeable future.
- 5 important factors:
  1. Higher substitution of labor by capital
  2. High capital income and high labor income overlaps.
  3. Capital income remain concentrated
  4. Assortive marriage
  5. Pro-rich policy.

## Perils of inequality: Plutocracy and Populism
** Does inequality threaten the sustainability of Western democratic capitalism? **
1. Inequality may ** not** danger capitalism, but **may** danger democratic capitalism
2. Decoupling of democracy and capitalism. Middle class prefer democracy but inequality hollow the middle class.
3. * The decline of middle class* : Leads to production focusing more on luxuries instead of middle class consumption.
- Also see an increase in guard jobs: 2% of total labor in US 2000.
