## Expectations and Output
### Fiscal policy
#### Keynes: *expansionary fiscal policy*
1. $GDP = C + I + G + EX - IM$
G &uarr; and other stay const. then GDP have to &uarr;
This case *multiplier* = 1.
2. Keynes: $\Delta$GDP = (Change in deficit spending by gov) $\times$ Income multiplier
multiplier = 1/ proportional leakage
This is an increase in *Nominal GDP* where $GDP = P * Q$
Idle productive resource &darr;  then Q &uarr;
If Idle productive resource = 0, then P &uarr; and GDP keeps &uarr;. This is overheating
3. This works in 1960- early 70.
4. Problems: 
- Leakage can be small *Ricardian equivalence* 
- *Crowding out* :  Interest rate &uarr;
- Central bank interest rate &uarr; for tighter monetary policy for counter inflation.
5. Forms of deficits: spending, tax cut.
## Expectations and Other Macro variables
- expectation can cause bubbles: 1990s internet and 2007 subprime mortgage.

# Chapter 4 Monetary policy in US
- 1780s and 90s. **Early years**. Dollar in terms of precious metals. Fixed exchange rate to precious metal.
- **1800s**:  Gold production not stable.
- **1913**: Irving Fisher suggests to reduce gold content in dollar to keep const. purchasing power. (didn't adopt)
- **1914** *Fed* established.  40% of gold reserve and $20.67 per ounce gold standard.
- **Early 1930** Great depression but high discount from fed.
- **1933** Roosevelt curtailed gold standard.
- **1970s** Dollar *float* on International market.
- **Early 1980s** Idea of a targeted 2 percent inflation rate. By manipulate the *short term interest rate*.
- **2007-2009** financial crisis and sovereign debt crisis in Europe. US: more loose. Europe: Tighter.

# Chapter 5 GDP Accounting
### Three measurement approaches
1. Value added
2. Income
3. Expenditure: most widely used
### Basic about expenditure method
$GDP = C + I + G + EX - IM$ GDP = consumption + investment + government expenditure + net exports.
### Depreciation
1. Gross domestic production(GDP) **excludes** deduction for depreciation (wear, tear, aging and accidental damage).
2. NDP (net domestic production) facing the difficulty of measuring depreciation accurately
### GDP vs GNP
1. GNP: *gross national product* : sum of output of country's residency regardless of where (maybe oversea)
2. GNI(income) is also used.
3. Some case GNP << GDP for some countries. (returns are paid to foreign capitals.
	Some examples: 2011 Luxembourg. GNP = 0.8GDP; Ireland: GNP = 0.72GDP.

### Historical and Cross-country comparison
1. **Fixed-price method** for calculate real GDP with a base year. 
	Problems: new goods appear, old good disappear, consuming pattern changes. &larr; use different base year gives difference result.
	Improvement 1996 US: *chained method*.
