## Expectations and Output
### Fiscal policy
#### Keynes: *expansionary fiscal policy*
1. $GDP = C + I + G + EX - IM$
G &uarr; and other stay const. then GDP have to &uarr;
This case *multiplier* = 1.
2. Keynes: $\Delta$GDP = (Change in deficit spending by gov) $\times$ Income multiplier
multiplier = 1/ proportional leakage
This is an increase in *Nominal GDP* where $GDP = P * Q$
Idle productive resource &darr;  then Q &uarr;
If Idle productive resource = 0, then P &uarr; and GDP keeps &uarr;. This is overheating
3. This works in 1960- early 70.
4. Problems: 
- Leakage can be small *Ricardian equivalence* 
- *Crowding out* :  Interest rate &uarr;
- Central bank interest rate &uarr; for tighter monetary policy for counter inflation.
5. Forms of deficits: spending, tax cut.
