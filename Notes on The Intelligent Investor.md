## A note about Benjamin Graham by Jason Zweig.
1. *Security analysis* Also by benjamin.
2. **5 core principles:**
	- A stock is not just a ticker symbol or an electronic blip; it is an ownership interest in an actual business, with an underlying value the does not depend on its share value.
	- The market is a pendulum that forever swings between unsustainable optimism and unjustified pessimism. The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to  optimists and buys from pessimists.
	- The future value of every investment is a function of its present price. The higher the price you pay, the lower your return will be.
	- No matter how careful you are, the one risk no investor can ever eliminate is the risk of being wrong. Only by insisting on what Graham called the 'margin of safety' - never overpaying, no matter how exciting an investment seems to be - can you minimise your odds of error.
	- The secret to your financial success is inside yourself. If you become a critical thinker who takes no Wall Street 'fact' on faith, and you invest with patient confidence, you can take steady advantage of even the worst bear markets. By developing your discipline and courage, you can refuse to let other people's mood swings govern your financial destiny. In the end, how your investments behaves is much less important than how you behave.

	Never delude yourself into thinking your are investing with speculation.
	Speculating becomes mortally dangerous the moment you begin to take it seriously.
	You must limit the amount of money you are wagering.

## what a defensive investor should do.
1. The purchase of the shares of well established investment funds  as an alternative to creating his own common-stock portfolio.
2. Utilize one of the common trust funds or commingled funds.
3. the device called dollar-cost averaging. (application of formula investing) Hold common stocks between 25%-75% in reverse to the action of market.
4. result should be slightly lower than the average performance of the market.

## Results to be expected by an aggressive investor.
Actions to get better return than the average:
1. Trade in the market. include short selling: ** ruled out from the domain of investment**
2. Short term selectivity. 
3. Long term selectivity.
- When considering selectivity: two challenges: human fallibility and the competition.

To get a better performance than average, one must: 1. inherently sound and promising. 2, not popular on wall street. Such policies should exist.
